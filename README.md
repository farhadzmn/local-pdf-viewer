# Local PDF Viewer for Extensions

This is a super simple HTML file that lets you open local PDF files in your browser using the `<object>` tag.  
It's especially useful if you want browser extensions (like [Chessvision.ai](https://www.chessvision.ai/)) to work with local PDFs.

## How to use

1. Open the HTML file in your browser.
2. Select a PDF file from your computer.
3. The PDF will be displayed as if it's part of a web page.
4. Browser extensions can now interact with it.

No server, no upload, 100% offline.  
Perfect for scanning chess books or documents using web-based tools.
